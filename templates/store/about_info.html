        <p class="lead text-muted">This website was created to catalog current sneakers that I have for sale as well as for demo purposes of a fully functioning deployed e-commerce web application.
            Kicksale's front-end was built using Bootstrap 4 with Python 3.9.6 and Django 4.0.6 as the backend.</p>
